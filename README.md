# Stockholm AI website
The Stockholm AI website.

# Local Debug Deploy
To serve the website without the nginx server
* Install Jekyll
* `jekyll serve`
* open `localhost:4000` in your web browser

It is tested to work with `jekyll 3.8.5`

# Full Local Debug Deploy
To serve the website as it is being deployed live, including the nginx server
* Install docker
* `./local_start.sh`
* open `localhost` in your web browser

## Troubleshoot
* Verify that your script actually continues to run (it should be in a so called watch-mode and react to changes in the filesystem)
* Verify that the script actually manages to compile the files. In the case of a compiltion error the script will continue to run but be unable to compile all the files needed.
* If you get permission errors and SELinux warnings (default in newer versions of Fedora for example). Set a security exception for the docker sandbox to access `pwd` by running
```
chcon -Rt svirt_sandbox_file_t `pwd`
```

We use Jekyll as our rendering tool. Quick introduction:

Example: "Changing the calendar html element to use ical
```
calendar.html           <-- provides the /route of calendar
_layouts/calendar.html  <-- gives the "layout of the calendar element
_includes/calendar.html <-- layout takes from _includes directory with the "meet" @jim
_data/*.yml             <-- for each page you have access to variables. Example {{ site.organization.title }}
```

# Changes to `_config.yml` [DEPRICATED]
`NOTE: not applicable for start.sh, only jekyll serve`
Changes to `_config.yml` does not propagate automatically with `jekyll serve`, instead put changing data under `_data` and keep the truly static stuff in `_config.yml`.
This also has the side-effect that if the `_config.yml` is missing when you start the `jekyll build --watch` it will just act like it's laking any data  and kindly compile everything with missing data (hence the `[[ -f _config ]]` check in the start script.
